* Algebraic closure

=Definition=

A subset of a given set is *closed* under an operation of the larger set if performing that operation on members of the subset always produces a member of that subset.

** Example
The natural numbers are closed under addition (but ot under subtraction, 1-2 is not a natural number although both 1 and 2 are).

* Quadratic Residues and Square Roots
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f6f0e7d8-d44a-4f89-a5e8-1f91bd7fd3e2
:END:

In the context of prime fields, an element that is a square of another element is called a *quadratic residue*.
Element that is not a square of another element is called a *quadratic non-residue*.

=Definition=

Let $p \in P$ be a prime number and $F_p$ it's associated prime field.
Then a number $x \in F_p$ is called a *square root* of another number $y \in F_p$ if $x$ is a solution to the following:

$x^2 = y$

In this case, $y$ is called a *quadratic residue* of $x$.
On the other hand, if $y$ is given and the quadratic equation has no solution $x$, we call $y$ a *quadratic non-residue*.

The [[id:c47a6a82-210a-4f26-b875-27f7ba758aaa][Euler's criterion]] is easily generalized to yield a test for squareness $\text{mod } n$ but in practice the
in practice, it is more efficient to use the [[id:9f4c15da-f06b-4c87-8ebc-acb9d25f9fe0][Extended Euclidean Algorithm]] to calculate the Jacobi symbol.
If n is an odd prime, this is equal to the Legendre symbol, and decides whether y is a quadratic residue modulo n

* DONE Roots of unity
In the context of finite fields *roots of unity* are elements of the field that when raised to a certain power equal 1.

** n-th Roots of Unity
=Definition=

In a finite field $F_q$, the n-th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation:

$x^n=1$

where :
- $x$ is an element of the field,
- $n$ is a positive integer.

=Key points=

- Since $F_{q}^{*}$ is cyclic, there are exactly $gcd(n,q - 1)$ n-th roots of unity in $F_q$.
- There exist n-th roots of unity in $F_q$ if and only if $n$ divides $q - 1$. This is because the order of any element in the multiplicative group $F_{q}^{*}$ divides the order of the group, which is $q - 1$.

** Primitive n-th Roots of Unity
=Definition=

An element $\zeta$ in $\mathbb{F}_q$ is called a *primitive $n$-th root of unity* if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. *Unity Condition*:
$\zeta^n = 1$
where $1$ is the multiplicative identity in $\mathbb{F}_q$.

2. *Primitive Condition*:
- The order of $\zeta$ must be exactly $n$, meaning that:

$\zeta^k = 1$ for any positive integer $k < n$ must not hold.

In other words, $\zeta$ should *not equal 1 until raised to the power of $n$.*
This implies that $\zeta$ generates the group of $n$-th roots of unity.

=Properties=
- A primitive $n$-th root of unity generates a cyclic group of order $n$ in the multiplicative group of the finite field.
- The set of all $n$-th roots of unity in $\mathbb{F}_q$ can be expressed as:

$\{ \zeta^k \mid k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1 \}$

- There are $\varphi(n)$ primitive $n$-th roots of unity in $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\varphi$ is the [[Euler's totient function][Euler's totient function]], denoting the number of integers up to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$.
** Example

In the finite field $\mathbb{F}_7$, the primitive $3$-rd roots of unity can be derived as follows:

1. The elements of $\mathbb{F}_7$ are $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
2. Check which elements satisfy $x^3 = 1$ in $\mathbb{F}_7$.
3. Identify the ones that generate roots distinctly without repetition until reaching $n$.

=Theorem=

For $p \in P$ (prime number) and $k \in Z$ every integer $k$ raised to the power of a prime number $p$ is congruent to itself modulo that prime:

$k^p \equiv k \quad \text{( mod p )}$

If $k$ is coprime to $p$, then we can divide both sides of this congruence by $k$ and get:

$k^{p - 1} \equiv 1  \quad \text{( mod p )}$

=Properties=

Fermat's Little Theorem can be used to find [[id:479ea448-94c4-438e-98dc-2920ffe5fac8][Multiplicative inverses]].

$k$ = 64 and $p$ = 137 ($k$ is coprime to $p$):

#+BEGIN_SRC sage :session . :exports both

ZZ(64)^ZZ(137) % ZZ(137) == ZZ(64) % ZZ(137)

# k is coprime to p

ZZ(64).gcd(137)
# hence

* Lagrange's theorem
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
If $H$ is a subgroup of any finite group $G$, then the sub-groups *order* (the number of elements) $|H|$ is a divisor of $|G|$,
i.e. the order (number of elements) of every subgroup $H$ divides the order of group $G$:

$\left[ H \right] \hspace{.5em} \text{divides} \hspace{.5em} \left[ G \right]$

** Polynomial factorization

=Definition=

Let $P \in R[x]$ be a polynomial.
Then there always exist irreducible polynomials $F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_k \in R[x]$, such that the following holds:

$P = F_1 \cdot F_2 \cdot  \ldots \cdot F_k$.

This representation is unique (except for permutations in the factors) and is called the prime factorization of $P$.
Each factor $F_i$ is called a prime factor of $P$.

*NOTE*

The above is an analog to the [[id:6402bede-282d-4b6a-a4f9-31092fc00739][Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic]] but applied to the ring of univariate polynomials $R[x]$.

** Irreducible polynomial
=Definition=

An *Irreducible polynomial* ss defined as a polynomial that cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials using Euclidean Division.

** Roots of the polynomial
=Definition=

Points where a polynomial evaluates to zero are called roots of the polynomial.

The roots of a polynomial are of special interest with respect to its prime factorization, since it can be shown that, for any given root $x_0$ of $P$, the polynomial $F(x) = (x - x_0)$ is a prime factor of $P$.
